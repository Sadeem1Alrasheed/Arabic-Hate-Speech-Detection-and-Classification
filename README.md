# Protecting Intellectual Security Through Hate Speech Detection Using Artificial Intelligence Approaches 
This project is part of my thesis: "Protecting Intellectual Security Through Hate Speech Detection Using Artificial Intelligence Approaches". It focuses on identifying and classifying hate speech in Arabic text to promote safer and more secure communication.
# Project Overview
This project aims to collect Arabic datasets from the social media platform X and develop a two-layer framework for detecting Arabic hate speech. The framework will classify the hate speech into specific types (Religious, Political or Social Hate speech ) using deep learning and machine learning techniques. The proposed framework aims to improve detection accuracy.
